	This contains a full bibliography for every software package used in The Effect. This includes every package mentioned in the book, used in any code examples, or used in the code that created the book. LaTeX packages are not included. Apologies if any details are wrong for the non-R packages, as these packages generally do not come with citation information embedded.
